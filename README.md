* npx create-react-app

* I imported a custom font called [Beaufort for LoL](https://brand.riotgames.com/en-us/league-of-legends/typography) using [@font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face).
* I deployed my React app to [GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment) using [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) because if not, it would only show the readme file.
